# final-assessment-deep-learning-nvidia

This was the final assessment on the "Getting Started with Deep Learning" course DLI Nvidia 

I learned about surface level Convolutional Neural Networks and NLP models. This course was done through PyTorch and Jupyter notebook. My model was able to reach a `94%` accuracy.

# Dataset/Model 

In the end, I was able to train a model to recognize fresh and rotten fruits. There were 6 categories of fruits: fresh apples, rotten apples, fresh oranges, rotten oranges, fresh bananas, and rotten bananas. The output layer consisted of 6 neurons; I used `categorical_crossentropy` to do the categorization.
